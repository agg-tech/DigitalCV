    <h2>PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>State the position you seek, the organization you want to work for (if applicable), and a few job-related skills you are
        bringing to the table (a.k.a. your “pitch”). In the second sentence, offer a little more about your character (soft skills) and tie
        in your personal mission; this is a good place to add some keyword filler for ATS if you cannot find a place to do so
        elsewhere in the resume. Stick to 1-2 sentences.
